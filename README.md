Convert the input string into an array of numbers.
Check if any element in the array is NaN (not a number). If so, return 1.
Sort the array in ascending order.
Check if the array forms an ascending sequence of integers starting with 1, with an increment of 1. If so, return 0.
If the array does not form such a sequence, find the lowest missing number in the sequence and return it.
